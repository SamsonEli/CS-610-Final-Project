# CS 610 Group 6 Final Project - Spoiled Meat Detection to Prevent Foodborne Illness


## Overview
Access to enough safe and nutritious food is key to sustaining life and promoting good health. Unsafe food that contains harmful bacteria, viruses, parasites, or chemicals can lead to over 200 diseases, ranging from nausea, fever and perhaps even cancer (World Health Organization, 2022). Ingestion of such bacteria typically will result in gastroenteritis, where the symptoms typically include but not limited to are nausea, fever, bloating and vomiting (Johns Hopkins Medicines, n.d.). Vulnerable groups, including young children, seniors, pregnant women, and individuals with chronic diseases, face a higher risk of fatality if food safety is not properly managed. 

An estimated of 600 million people fall ill after eating contaminated food, leading to approximately 420,000 deaths annually. (World Health Organization, 2022) As global meat consumption continues to rise steadily over the years (Statista, 2024), ensuring the safety of food becomes increasingly crucial to prevent further casualties and fatalities. A robust system needs to be implemented to track meat quality before consumption. In this research paper, we will be exploring Artificial Intelligence technology and will be utilizing Machine Learning to evaluate the effectiveness of the various models (Qing, Zhang, & Wang, 2022).

## Background Information
The predominant bacteria associated with spoilage of refrigerated beef and pork, are Brochothrix thermosphacta, Carnobacterium spp., Enterobacteriaceae, Lactobacillus spp., Leuconostoc spp., Pseudomonas spp. and Shewanella putrefaciens (Borch, Kant-Muermans, & Blixt , 1996). It is known that bacteria are a few of the microbes that can generate natural colors (Agarwal, et al., 2023). A snapshot of the listed bacteria is provided in the appendix as Figure 2.

Deep learning models can classify images by breaking them down into their RGB values and using convolutional layers to detect patterns and features at various levels of abstraction. (Nisha, Sathik, & Meeral, 2020). As a result, we will be exploring the various Machine Learning models, including self-built ones, to see which the best model is to detect whether the meat has turned stale.
